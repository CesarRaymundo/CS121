* Author: Cesar Raymundo

## Overview

This project when it is compiled, runs a java file that does not need user interaction. 
It can run without any user interaction. This program consists of three objects being 
animated on top of a background. 


## Compiling and Running

Instructions to Compile:

Start by typing "javac TrafficAnimation.java" and hit enter.
Then, type "java TrafficAnimation" then hit enter again.
The file should be compiled and running.  

 
## Reflection (Project Development and Testing)

The first issue I had during this project was that my truck was not scaling
right with the background. When the window screen would get smaller or bigger the truck
would still stay the same size, the way I found this issue was with the help of
one of my peers. They helped me notice that I hardcoded a number instead of using 
a variable value to make sure it scales. The other issue I had was when I was coding the 
Pac-Man, I was using angles and I was having a hard time figuring out where to start the angle
and when to end it, but with the help of the Java Foundation book on Appendix F, I found 
the section where it talks about angles and it helped understand better to be able to have a Pac-
Man on my project. 

Parts I found challenging for this project was doing my buildings in the background and
my observer. I was still a little confused on how to have other objects in the program to be edge 
to edge or in the middle of the other object. With the help with on my friends that
are also taking CS121 helped to figure out to have things go side to side and then it finally
clicked and I was able to my observer. 
 
I made sure it can be compiled and ran on Onyx and the way I made sure I met all the require-
ments is by going over the project 0 requirements. My program cannot handle bad input, because
the program does not require input to be ran. My program can be idiot-proof, but it depends
on the user. A person that is unfamiliar with the setup can have issues with this.
As of right now, they are none known issues on my program
